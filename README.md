## Features

### Product Catalog Management
- **Implementation:** Admin UI for CRUD operations on products and inventory, stored in MongoDB.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring real-time updates and validation.
- **Solution:** Used Mongoose for schema validation and Zustand for state management.

### Shopping Cart
- **Implementation:** Persistent cart using Zustand and localStorage; supports add, remove, and update.
- **Challenge:** Cart state consistency across sessions.
- **Solution:** Zustand middleware for state persistence.

### Payment Gateway Integration
- **Implementation:** Stripe/PayPal integration (test mode) for secure payments and order confirmation.
- **Challenge:** Handling errors and concurrency.
- **Solution:** Robust error handling and user feedback via toasts.

### Order Processing
- **Implementation:** Orders stored in MongoDB with detailed info; admin dashboard for management.
- **Challenge:** Atomic order creation and inventory updates.
- **Solution:** Server-side validation and API endpoints.

### 3D Virtual Showroom
- **Implementation:** Three.js and React Three Fiber for interactive 3D product viewing.
- **Challenge:** Web performance.
- **Solution:** Lazy loading and dynamic imports for 3D assets.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** Modular React components; Next.js pages/hooks for business logic.
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes for `/api/products`, `/api/orders`, `/api/auth`, etc.
- **Database:** MongoDB collections for users, products, orders, and categories (via Mongoose).

**Example API Endpoint:**
```
// app/api/products/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Fetch products from DB
    return NextResponse.json(await Product.find({}))
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to fetch products" }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```


**Design Patterns:**
- Container/Presentational component split
- Atomic design for UI components
- Middleware for authentication and error handling

## Code Examples

**Cart Management with Zustand:**
```
import create from 'zustand';

export const useCart = create((set) => ({
  cart: [],
  addToCart: (item) => set((state) => ({ cart: [...state.cart, item] })),
  removeFromCart: (id) => set((state) => ({ cart: state.cart.filter(i => i.id !== id) })),
  clearCart: () => set({ cart: [] }),
}));
```

**MongoDB Product Schema:**
```
const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  description: String,
  image: String,
  category: String,
  stock: Number,
});
```


---

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Real-time cart updates:** Zustand and localStorage sync for persistence.
- **Secure authentication:** NextAuth.js with JWT and server-side role checks.
- **3D rendering:** Code splitting, dynamic imports, optimized 3D models.
- **Order validation:** Atomic backend operations and UI loading states.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Strategies:**
  - Unit tests for utilities and business logic
  - Integration tests for API endpoints (Jest + Supertest)
  - UI tests with React Testing Library and Cypress
  - Manual end-to-end testing for shopping, payment, and admin flows
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, ESLint, Prettier

---

## Deployment

- **Platform:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Setup:**
  1. Fork/clone the repository
  2. Create a `.env` file with MongoDB URI, Stripe/PayPal API keys, and NextAuth secrets
  3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  4. Run locally: `npm run dev`
  5. Deploy to Vercel: connect repo, set environment variables

## Future Enhancements

- Real payment (Stripe/PayPal live mode)
- Advanced product filtering and search (e.g., Algolia)
- User reviews and ratings
- Wishlist/favorites
- PWA support
- AI-powered recommendations
- Analytics and marketing integrations
- Accessibility and localization
